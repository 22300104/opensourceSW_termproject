## AR Face Filter Project 
## 1. 프로젝트 개요 (Project Overview)
This project is a real-time Augmented Reality (AR) application developed using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**. The system detects faces and hands through a webcam to apply dynamic digital filters and enable touchless interaction. 

It goes beyond simple overlays by implementing advanced computer vision techniques such as:
*   **Mesh-based Face Distortion** (Liquid warp effects)
*   **Texture Mapping** (Face painting that adheres to skin)
*   **Physics-based Particle Systems** (Interactive elements)
*   **Hand Gesture Recognition** (Touchless UI control)

## 3. 주요 기능 (Key Features)

### 🎭 Advanced Face Filters
1.  **Face Distortion (Big Eyes)**
    *   Uses localized mesh warping to enlarge eyes in real-time.
    *   Adjustable distortion strength and radius.
2.  **Face Painting (Joker)**
    *   Applies texture directly onto the face mesh (lips, eyes) using polygon rendering.
    *   The makeup moves naturally with facial expressions.
3.  **Interactive Particles**
    *   Opening the mouth triggers a physics-based fire particle system.
4.  **2D Accessories**
    *   Overlays glasses, hats, and crowns aligned with specific facial landmarks.

### 🖐 Gesture Control Interface
Control the application without touching the keyboard:
*   **✌️ V-Sign**: Take a Screenshot
*   **🖐️ Palm**: Navigate Menu (Next Item)
*   **✊ Fist**: Select / Deselect Item
*   **☝️ Index Point**: Change Virtual Background

### 🖼️ Virtual Backgrounds
*   Replaces the real background with **Blur**, **Solid Colors**, or **Pattern Images** using Selfie Segmentation.
